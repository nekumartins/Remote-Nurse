Hypertension Risk Monitoring App
This app is designed to make it easy to remotely monitor a patient's risk for hypertension. It uses simulated data for demonstration purposes, but the ultimate goal is to link it to a Bluetooth bracelet that will transmit real-time blood pressure data to the app.

How it Works
-Users input their personal information, including age, gender, height, and weight.
-The app calculates the user's BMI category based on their height and weight.
-Users can also input their family history of hypertension and their blood pressure readings.
-The app determines the user's risk of hypertension based on their age, gender, BMI category, family history, and blood pressure readings.
-The user's overall hypertension risk is displayed on the screen, along with their BMI category.

Simulated Data
For demonstration purposes, the app uses simulated data. Users can input their personal information and blood pressure readings, and the app will calculate their hypertension risk based on this data. The app does not transmit any data outside of the user's device.

Bluetooth Bracelet Integration
The ultimate goal of this app is to integrate it with a Bluetooth bracelet that will transmit the users real-time data to the app. This in conjunction with the an ai which would be trained on real life data will allow monitoring of the users blood pressure and hypertension risk in real time and share this date with their health care provider


*Please note that this feature is not yet available in the current version of the app, but will be added in a future versions of the app.
